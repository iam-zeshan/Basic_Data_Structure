/*
Just like, I've learned in 'Basics of JavaScrip' in the previouse cource that, how we can access the array's data.

Task:
In order to complete this challenge, set the 2nd position (index 1) of myArray to anything you want, besides the letter b.
let myArray = ["a", "b", "c", "d"];
// Only change code below this line

// Only change code above this line
console.log(myArray);

*/
let myArray = ["a", "b", "c", "d"];
// Only change code below this line
myArray[1] = "I have to increase my Productivity";
// Only change code above this line
console.log(myArray);
